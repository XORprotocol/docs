# XOR Protocol Whitepaper

Apr 2nd, 2018

## Abstract
_The XOR Protocol is a financial system built on a distributed public ledger that supports a unique class
of markets and securities, which are more transparent, decentralized, democratic, and general than current
systems. Examples include simple loans, mortgage bonds, and derivative markets such as Collateral Debt
Obligations (CDO) and Credit Default Swaps (CDS). XOR uses smart contracts to model any type of loan.
Many markets can be modeled as debt contracts, thus enabling a universe of potential XOR markets with
the aforementioned benefits over their current analogs. All market transactions are recorded on a public
ledger using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), a more general paradigm of blockchain technologies,
in order to ensure end-to-end transparency. An additional benefit of XORâ€™s decentralized approach is the
elimination of parasitic fees, such as fees from third party credit ratings agencies, insurance providers, and
centralized banks. Borrowers receive superior borrowing rates and lenders receive higher ROI. Another
important aspect of XOR is self governance and modularity. Actors in the system will be able to choose
their own credit score implementations, insurance rates, risk models, and any other market variables. We
can assume that any given model will not stay relevant for infinite time, but in the future at least one type
of basic functioning model will exist. XOR aims to rectify this by allowing democratized modularity in
the creation of markets. This flexibility is important in order to ensure that the XOR Protocol can adapt to
future changes in market and real-life circumstances. In addition, XOR is designed as a protocol layer
rather than as its own system. This makes it possible to build XOR on top of any other currency system,
i.e. the Ethereum network or the Bitcoin network. As long as at least one distributed ledger exists, the
XOR Protocol can exist. XOR will open doors to fair loans and credit access to people across the world
by providing an accessible platform through which anyone in the world can create a market or invest in
markets in a way that is transparent, distributed, fair, and flexible._
